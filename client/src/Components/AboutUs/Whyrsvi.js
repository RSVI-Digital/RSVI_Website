                      It is important to mention here that there is a dearth of
                      reading material and information in accessaile formats (Audio,
                      Braille, E-Text) for the visually impaired resulting in creating
                      an insurmountable problem for the students and other
                      professional requiring constant updating of their knowledge. It
                      is estimated that less than 0.5% of books printed in india are
                      converted into audio and Braille formats, let alone
                      international publications. As a matter of fact, rehabilitation
                      services are available to less than 5% of people suffering from
                      blindness and low vision.
                      <br />
                      The magnitude of the problem may be assessed from the following:{" "}
                      <ol>
                        <li>Total number of schools for the blind in the state of Utter
                      Pradesh with a population of more than 20 crores is less than
                      25.</li>
                        <li>Government Braille Production Centers including NGO's in the
                      entire country is less than 10.</li>
                        <li>Audio Reording Centers of books run by government and NGO's
                      in the entire country is less than 15.</li>
                        <li>Audio-Conversion Centers in the state of UP is only one.</li>
                      </ol>
